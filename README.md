*   **Captcha Handling**: If Flipkart detects bot activity, appropriate fallback logic is executed.
    
*   **Debugging Statements**: Real-time logs to identify issues during scraping.
    

üìà Performance
--------------

*   Designed with multithreading to fetch and process data faster.
    
*   Automatically adapts to website delays and throttling using time.sleep() and retry logic.
